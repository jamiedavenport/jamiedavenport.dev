INTRODUCTION HERE

- What is the 100 Days of Code thiny?
- Overview of this article
- tl;dr?

## Goals

- Why did I choose to commit myself to the challenge?

I already code regularly:

- Full-time job
- Side-projects
- Open-source

But I'm not very good at shouting about the work I do. Hence, 100DaysOfCode will force me to actually tweet about it more regularly.
