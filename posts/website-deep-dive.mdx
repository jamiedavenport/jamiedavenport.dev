Recently I've been rebuilding my personal website. Previously it was build on Gatsby & NetlifyCMS but I experienced some issues with that stack:

- I mostly work with NextJS and working on the website required a frustrating context switch
- The workflow of writing new posts was too slow in NetlifyCMS
- I used a Gatsby blog starter which was difficult to fully customise

Credit to the [Tailwind Blog](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/building-the-tailwind-blog) for technical inspiration.

## Tech Stack

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) I've completely migrated away from the CSS in Javascript and gone all in on the [utility-first](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) approach
- [MDX Remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) which allows me to use `getStaticProps` to load blog post content albeit with a few limitations
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) I could also have used [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) but my domain was already hosted on Netlify DNS ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/) instead of GA for analytics. It's privacy-first, simple and transparent üíØ

## Writing Blog Posts

- MDX Files stored under `/posts`
- Frontmatter for metadata (due to the limitations of MDX Remote)
- Write them in VSCode
- Run `yarn dev` to see the blog post locally
- Push to a branch and use Netlify preivew branches to see the production build before publishing
- Publishing is a PR into `main`
- Improvement over the NetlifyCMS approach which was slow
- Custom components such as `Achievement` give the post more substance

## Image Generation

- Generate promotional images for Twitter etc
- Twitter and OpenGraph tags
- Headless Chrome
- Util page
- Reuse my existing components which will automatically propagate to new posts

## Future
