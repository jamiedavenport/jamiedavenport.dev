Recently I've been rebuilding my personal website. Previously it was build with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) & [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) but I experienced some issues with this stack:

- I mostly work with NextJS and working on the website required a frustrating context switch
- My workflow when writing new posts with NetlifyCMS was too slow
- The Gatsby blog starter which was difficult to fully customise

## Tech Stack

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) I've completely migrated away from CSS in Javascript and gone all in on the [utility-first](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) approach
- [MDX Remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) which allows me to use `getStaticProps` to load blog post content albeit with a few limitations
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) I could also have used [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) but my domain was already hosted on Netlify DNS ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/) instead of GA for analytics. It's privacy-first, simple and transparent üíØ

## Blog Posts

TODO: Talk about `getStaticProps`, `getStaticPaths` and `MDX Remote` for generating pages

One of the key goals of this rebuild was to make it easier to write blog posts, therefore giving me no excuse but to write more. I treat blog posts as any other feature and use the same tools (VSCode, Git, etc).

A post is a single `.mdx` file that's stored under `/posts`. Writing Markdown is very familiar to me vs a rich text editor, and MDX allows me to add custom React components such as `Achievement` that give context or interactivity to posts. Post metadata is stored in the frontmatter.

## Blog Content Goes Here
```

The current post workflow looks like:

1. Create a new branch for the post: `gco -b post/awesome-post`
1. Run `yarn dev` to view the post locally
1. Write the post in VSCode using a MDX extension
1. Use Netlify preview branches to get a live preview that I can get proofread
1. Publish the post by merging the feature branch into `main`

## Design

- My preferred approach to styling websites
- Tailwind Typography for the blog content
- Beth for images
- Designed it myself

## Image Generation

- Generate promotional images for Twitter etc
- Twitter and OpenGraph tags
- Headless Chrome
- Util page
- Reuse my existing components which will automatically propagate to new posts

## Future

- Future features of the site
- Continue to learn more about accessibility
