description: Why and how I built my new personal website

Recently I've been rebuilding my personal website. Previously it was build on Gatsby & NetlifyCMS but I experienced some issues with that stack:

- I mostly work with NextJS and working on the website required a frustrating context switch
- The workflow of writing new posts was too slow in NetlifyCMS
- I used a Gatsby blog starter which was difficult to fully customise

Credit to the [Tailwind Blog](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/building-the-tailwind-blog) for technical inspiration.

## Tech Stack

- NextJS
- Tailwind
- MDX Remote
  - Alternative would be a Webpack loader
  - MDX allows me to use `getStaticProps` which is how data should be loaded in Next
  - Comes with some limitations
- Netlify
  - Already using Netlify, great features, domain already hosted there (compared to Vercel)
- Fathom
  - Simpler than GA
  - Privacy, no tracking cookies (TODO: Add links to Fathom's blog posts & feature list)

## Writing Blog Posts

- MDX Files stored under `/posts`
- Frontmatter for metadata (due to the limitations of MDX Remote)
- Write them in VSCode
- Run `yarn dev` to see the blog post locally
- Push to a branch and use Netlify preivew branches to see the production build before publishing
- Publishing is a PR into `main`
- Improvement over the NetlifyCMS approach which was slow
- Custom components such as `Achievement` give the post more substance

## Blog Content Goes Here
```

## Design

- My preferred approach to styling websites
- Tailwind Typography for the blog content
- Beth for images
- Designed it myself

## Image Generation

- Generate promotional images for Twitter etc
- Twitter and OpenGraph tags
- Headless Chrome
- Util page
- Reuse my existing components which will automatically propagate to new posts

## Future

- Future features of the site
- Continue to learn more about accessibility
