## Motivation

- Replace Gatsby
- No context switching
- Easier to write blog posts
- Easier to add new features

- Credit to the Tailwind Blog for inspiration

## Tech Stack

- NextJS
- Tailwind
- MDX Remote
- Netlify
  - Already using Netlify, great features, domain already hosted there (compared to Vercel)

## Structure

- Post Structure
- Prefer writing posts in MDX within VSCode than I do in NetlifyCMS
- Instant feedback (`yarn dev`), git workflows etc.
- Work on new ideas on branches and get preview deploys for feedback

## Blog Posts

- `getStaticProps`

## Design

- My preferred approach to styling websites
- Tailwind Typography for the blog content
- Issue with embedding MDX components
- Beth for images
- Designed it myself

## Image Generation

- Generate promotional images for Twitter etc
- Twitter and OpenGraph tags
- Headless Chrome
- Util page
- Reuse my existing components which will automatically propagate to new posts

## Future

- Future features of the site
- Continue to learn more about accessibility
