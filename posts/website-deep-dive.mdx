## Motivation

- Replace Gatsby
- No context switching
- Easier to write blog posts
- Easier to add new features

- Credit to the Tailwind Blog for inspiration

## NextJS

- Use it for everything else

## MDX

- Prefer writing posts in MDX within VSCode than I do in NetlifyCMS
- Instant feedback (`yarn dev`), git workflows etc.

## Tailwind

- My preferred approach to styling websites
- Tailwind Typography for the blog content
- Issue with embedding MDX components

## Image Generation

- Generate promotional images for Twitter etc
- Twitter and OpenGraph tags
- Headless Chrome
- Util page
- Reuse my existing components which will automatically propagate to new posts

##Â Netlify

- Previous website was already deployed and domain registered there
- Use their preview deploys to see production builds of blog posts

## Future

- Future features of the site
- Continue to learn more about accessibility
