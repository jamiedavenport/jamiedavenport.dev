Welcome to the first in a series of weekly updates. The goal of these is to reflect on the previous week and build motivation for the next.

## New Website

The major project this week has been the rebuild of my personal website (the one you're on right now). I'm currently writing up a technical deep dive but in the meantime you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/jamiedavenport/jamiedavenport.dev).

Thanks to [Beth Davenport](https://bethdavenport.design) designing the awesome logo.

## Open Source Contributions

Over the last week I've made a couple of contributions to [BlitzJS](https://blitzjs.com/):

- [1247](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/pull/1247) adds a shim to Blitz for `requestIdleCallback` which is experimental and not supported by every browser
- [1223](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/pull/1223) adds a more useful error message when developers try to use regular functions with `useQuery` and `useMutation`

  I've officially become an L1 maintainer of the project

## [TailwindUI x BlitzJS Recipe](https://github.com/jamiedavenport/blitzjs-tailwindui-recipe)

I often use [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com/) in new projects because it makes the task of building great UX significantly easier (a skill I'm very bad at).

This TailwindUI recipe for Blitz allows you to setup [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and TailwindUI in a single command:

```bash
blitz install jamiedavenport/blitzjs-tailwindui-recipe
```

## Baking

Like every other techie during lockdown, I've stayed sane by baking bread. This week I've baked these dinner rolls using [Joshua Weissman's recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9le93pztbU&t=387s).

## Reading

Reread [MAKE book](https://makebook.io/) by [@levelsio](https://twitter.com/levelsio). I'm planning on using the techniques described here to when working through my backlog of ideas.

## What's Next

- Continue to contribute to Blitz üöÄ
- Work on improving my written communication skills and write up some more blog posts üìù
- Start working on a new project (not sure what that will be) üíº
