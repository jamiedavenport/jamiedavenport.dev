Welcome to the first in a series of weekly updates. The point of these posts is to be able to reflect on the achievements of the week, a sort of retrospective on my projects, and share what I've learned with you all.

## New Website

- Rebuild of this website

  - As a place to highlight personal projects
  - To reduce the pain of context switching and make it easier to add new features by changing it to NextJS
  - Replaces my old Gatsby site
  - Post coming soon on the technical details
  - Link to the repo

- Writing blog posts

  - To make it easier to author blog posts

## Open Source Contributions

- Intro to [BlitzJS](https://blitzjs.com/), why I want to work on it

  - BlitzJS makes it simpler to build full-stack websites with NextJS
  - My favourite tool because it allows me to bootstrap new projects my quicker / more productive

- Set out to contribute to more open source at the start of the year

  - Taken a long time to do it with any consistency
  - Goal of larning more and helping to drive tools I use forward

- PRs
  - [1247](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/pull/1247) adds a shim to Blitz for `requestIdleCallback` which is experimental and not supported by every browser
  - [1223](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/pull/1223) adds a more useful error message when developers try to use regular functions with `useQuery` and `useMutation`

## [TailwindUI x BlitzJS Recipe](https://github.com/jamiedavenport/blitzjs-tailwindui-recipe)

- BlitzJS has the concept of recipes

  - Easily install 3rd party code
  - Many official recipes exist but it's also simple to write your own

- What is it?

  - This recipe installs TailwindUI (and TailwindCSS)
  - TailwindUIs components make it significantly easier to build a beautiful UX, again making it quicker to bootstrap new ideas
  - This stack is my favourite for new projects and I hope this recipe also helps other developers

## Baking

- Baking

  - One of the many hobbies I've picked up during the pandemic
  - Made these [dinner rolls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9le93pztbU&t=387s) with a recipe from Joshua Weissman

## MAKE Book

- [MAKE book](https://makebook.io/) is a book by [this guy](https://twitter.com/levelsio)
- Explains an approach of starting profitable businesses called Bootstrapping
- Motivation for my own projects

## Podcasts

- List of podcasts that I've been listening to

## Conclusion

- Fun and productive week
- Plan to continue with development of the personal site & contribute more features to Blitz
- Also have some ideas for projects that I want to kick off in the next week
