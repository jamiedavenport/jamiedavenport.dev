Welcome to the first in a series of weekly updates. I'm writing these updates to relfect on the achievements of the week and to build motiviation for the weeks ahead.

## New Website

The major project this week has been the rebuild of my personal website (the one you're on right now). Previously, it was a simple [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) starter, while most of my other projects use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). By migrating to Next.js I can use my existing knowledge, can share code between projects and have alleviated any context switching issues.

It's significantly easier to publish blog posts for the new site. This has renewed my excitement for writing and over the next few months I'm going to work on improving my written communication skills. I've already got a few ideas in the pipeline, one of these is a technical deep dive into how this site works (coming soon) but in the meantime feel free to have a look at the [code](https://github.com/jamiedavenport/jamiedavenport.dev).

## Open Source Contributions

- Intro to [BlitzJS](https://blitzjs.com/), why I want to work on it

  - BlitzJS makes it simpler to build full-stack websites with NextJS
  - My favourite tool because it allows me to bootstrap new projects my quicker / more productive

- Set out to contribute to more open source at the start of the year

  - Taken a long time to do it with any consistency
  - Goal of larning more and helping to drive tools I use forward

- PRs
  - [1247](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/pull/1247) adds a shim to Blitz for `requestIdleCallback` which is experimental and not supported by every browser
  - [1223](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/pull/1223) adds a more useful error message when developers try to use regular functions with `useQuery` and `useMutation`

## [TailwindUI x BlitzJS Recipe](https://github.com/jamiedavenport/blitzjs-tailwindui-recipe)

- BlitzJS has the concept of recipes

  - Easily install 3rd party code
  - Many official recipes exist but it's also simple to write your own

- What is it?

  - This recipe installs TailwindUI (and TailwindCSS)
  - TailwindUIs components make it significantly easier to build a beautiful UX, again making it quicker to bootstrap new ideas
  - This stack is my favourite for new projects and I hope this recipe also helps other developers

## Baking

- Baking

  - One of the many hobbies I've picked up during the pandemic
  - Made these [dinner rolls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9le93pztbU&t=387s) with a recipe from Joshua Weissman

- Explains an approach of starting profitable businesses called Bootstrapping
- Motivation for my own projects

## Podcasts

- List of podcasts that I've been listening to

## Conclusion

- Fun and productive week
