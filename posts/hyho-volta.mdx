- What is hyho?

<RepoCard />

- Introduction to Volta
- Javascript tool manager
- Written in Rust and shipped as a static binary
- Easy to install with automatic setup for popular shells
- Complete with simple completions for various shells

## What's the problem

- It works on my machine e.g. Dev A is using node 12 locally and another is using node 14
- Different projects have different toolchain requirements e.g. Project A is node 12 and another is node 14

## The solution

- Ensures that everyone has the same versions of tools
- Allows you to install binaries from NPM on your machine
- Allows you to pin versions of a tool for a particular project.
- This gets stored in `package.json`

```json
"volta": {
  "node": "14.15.4",
  "yarn": "1.22.5"
}
```

- Volta automatically switches versions of your tools whenever you change directory
- If a project requires a certain tool which you do not have installed then it will automatically install it (IMG)

### Shims

* Could be a subsection here or it could be another article entirely

## Example

- Show that I've switched my projects to use Volta
- It was quick, simple and pain free
- Also installed it on my work laptop which was previously using different versions of the toolchain
- Has prevented errors that have occured before
- Volta in CI?

## Meet the competition

### NVM

- No automatic switching for NVM, you must use `nvm use` or setup your shell manually to do this
- Speed / Performance
- Installation? Compatability? Worth checking?

## Who should use this

### Enterprises & Open-Source

- Makes onboarding easy. You need only install Volta to get setup with the toolchain
- Never hear the words "It works for me" again (No guarantees)
- Extra context for bug reports, we would already know the toolchain if Volta is used

###Â Personal Use

- If you have a lot of different project, the seamless switching makes it easy to be using the correct toolchain
- Makes it easier to install tools across multiple devices (work v personal)
