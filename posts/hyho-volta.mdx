Welcome to the first post in my "Have you heard of" series where I find new and niche technologies then try to explain them as simply as possible. I'll try to explain the problems that they solve, compare them to competetors and figure out who, if anyone, should use these tools. 

This post is all about Volta, enjoy!

<RepoCard />

Volta is a _Javascript tool manager_. What does that mean? Well, it means Volta helps you to manage multiple versions of `node`, `npm` and `yarn` for differnet projects.

It can be installed with a single line and comes with automatic setup and completions for popular shells.

## What's the problem

It's the age old problem of _"it works on my machine"_. This can occur quite frequently when multiple people are working on a single project such as in a large enterprise or open-source.

As a developer you probably have multiple projects that you work on and each might also have different requirements. How do you manage all these different toolchain versions? _It would be funny if the answer wasn't Volta_

## The solution

- Ensures that everyone has the same versions of tools
- Allows you to install binaries from NPM on your machine
- Allows you to pin versions of a tool for a particular project.
- This gets stored in `package.json`

```json
"volta": {
  "node": "14.15.4",
  "yarn": "1.22.5"
}
```

Here's the cool part, Volta automatically switches your toolchain whenever you change directory ðŸ¤¯.

If you don't have the specific version installed then Volta will install it for you whenever you use it for the first time.

## Example

- Show that I've switched my projects to use Volta
- It was quick, simple and pain free
- Also installed it on my work laptop which was previously using different versions of the toolchain
- Has prevented errors that have occured before
- Volta in CI?

## Meet the competition

### NVM

- No automatic switching for NVM, you must use `nvm use` or setup your shell manually to do this
- Speed / Performance
- Installation? Compatability? Worth checking?

### Docker

- Also can be used to 
- Slower and has a higher learning curve

## Who should use this

### Enterprises & Open-Source

- Makes onboarding easy. You need only install Volta to get setup with the toolchain
- Never hear the words "It works for me" again (No guarantees)
- Extra context for bug reports, we would already know the toolchain if Volta is used
- Can be configured to fetch binaries from other places such as a private registry
- Support for workspaces (monorepos)

### Personal Use

- If you have a lot of different project, the seamless switching makes it easy to be using the correct toolchain
- Makes it easier to install tools across multiple devices (work v personal)

## Community

- Have a formal request for comments process for large changes https://github.com/volta-cli/rfcs where you can have your voice heard
- Discord chat
