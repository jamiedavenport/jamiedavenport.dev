## Personal Website

Continued to add features and improvements to the personal website:

- Accessibility improvements
- React components such as `Achievement` for use in blog posts
- Added [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) and [Lint Staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)

## Blog Posts

I've been writing a post about the technical details of this website. This should be released some time _next week_.

## Blitz

- Working on this issue ([Issue](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/issues/913), [PR](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/pull/1325)) most of the week. It's been a difficult one that's tought me a lot about NodeJS ðŸš€
- Enjoying performing L1 maintainer duties. I find helping others in the community to be some of the most meaningful work I've done

## Misc

- Working through [EpicReact](https://epicreact.dev/). I'm hoping that I learn some advanced patterns I've never seen before.
- Tried out the two new Hashicorp products: [Waypoint](https://www.waypointproject.io/) & [Boundary](https://www.boundaryproject.io/). I'm planning to contribute to these in order to refresh my Go skills which are a bit rusty
