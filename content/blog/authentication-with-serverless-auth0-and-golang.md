Before we get started with the tutorial I want to give a bit of context about myself to help you understand the value I get from using this tech stack. Like most Software Engineers my personal projects fall into one of two classes:
Examples that I build while learning something new
Tools that solve my real-life problems
This tech stack applies to the second group of projects, the ones where you want to start writing the business logic ASAP.

AWS, Serverless Framework and Auth0 are excellent solutions in this field because of their low running cost and fast lead time for new features. I use Golang because I'm familiar with it, there are other benefits such as static analysis and small final binary but I would suggest using whatever language you are most comfortable with. A popular choice is NodeJS which already has amazing tooling and documentation courtesy of its large community.
